A set of .NET MAUI drawn controls.

![AlohaKit Gallery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsuarezruiz/AlohaKit/main/images/alohakit-gallery.png)

_NOTE: There is an experimental project in .NET called [Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Controls](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Controls) (GraphicsControls) with drawn controls. The main goal of GraphicsControls is to validate if there are interest in .NET MAUI drawn controls, creating the controls that were available in [Xamarin.Forms Visual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/visual/material-visual) with Cupertino, Fluent and Material Design. GraphicsControls controls implement existing controls in .NET MAUI in a drawn way with the same properties, events, etc. 
On the other hand, AlohaKit is a personal project also with drawn controls but without strictly following the .NET MAUI control interfaces. That is, we can have in AlohaKit a Rating control for example that was not part of Xamarin.Forms Visual or the Button control can have a Stroke property of type Brush while in .NET MAUI it is a Color. AlohaKit main goal is to offer more options to developers with more controls showing another way to create controls but is not an alternative or replacement for GraphicsControls, are not the same library and do not have the same goals._
